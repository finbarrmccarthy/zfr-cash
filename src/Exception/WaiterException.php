/**
 * In some cases, Stripe sends a lot of different events nearly simultaneously. For example, when creating
 * a new subscription, Stripe automatically generates both an "invoice.created" and "invoice.payment_succeeded"
 * event. However, when processed server-side, there must be some order that must be guaranteed.
 *
 * As Stripe resends events whenever it receives a non-200 HTTP status code, we can throw this exception to
 * force a non-200 error, and let Stripe resends the event later
